# Missing-Data-Estimation-Method-for-Durability-Survey-of-Reinforced-Concrete-Structures
This repository contains the three phases of the methodology used in my article. Each phase is separated so they can be run independently. The files that begin with "input" are the data files that need to be read by the programs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The programs were developed using [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and Python. Below is the Python version and environment information:
Python 3.11.4 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Jul 5 2023, 13:38:37) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]

## Libraries
The following Python libraries are required to run the programs:
-pandas as pd
-numpy as np
-matplotlib.pyplot as plt
-seaborn as sns
-statsmodels.api as sm
-scipy.stats as stats
-statsmodels.formula.api as smf
-from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
-math
-random
